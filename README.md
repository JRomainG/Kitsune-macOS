Kitsune is a macOS client for [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org), built using [MangaDexLib](https://github.com/JRomainG/MangaDexLib), to browse, read, and download your favorite mangas.

## Development

To install, simply checkout the `dev` branch of this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JRomainG/Kitsune-macOS.git
git checkout dev
```

You will then be able to open the `Kitsune-macOS.xcodeproj` project. Swift's package manager should automatically download both [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup) and [MangaDexLib](https://github.com/JRomainG/MangaDexLib). Don't forget to change the team and signing certificate before building.

This project uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce Swift style and conventions.
